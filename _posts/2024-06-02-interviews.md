title: "Technical Interviews & Feedback"
---

Technical interviews are extremely commonplace when hiring developers but the
practice of providing feedbacks, not so much. The upside of providing feedback
is however notable, and there is minimal or zero downside to both the company
and the interviewer.


Recently I came across [this article](https://interviewing.io/blog/no-engineer-has-ever-sued-a-company-because-of-constructive-post-
interview-feedback-so-why-dont-employers-do-it) explaining that interviewers
should try to provide feedback to candidates after the interview, and goes on
to explain about how the feedback should be provided with examples. Further, it
also mentions that there are no known cases of any feedbacks leading to legal
action against companies, and despite this, providing feedbacks is not encouraged.

Here are my thoughts on this. First of all, I think it has a lot to do with the
culture of the company.
