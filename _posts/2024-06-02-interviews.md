title: "Technical Interviews & Feedback"
---

Technical interviews are extremely commonplace when hiring developers but the
practice of providing feedbacks, not so much. The upside of providing feedback
is however notable, and there is minimal or zero downside to both the company
and the interviewer.


Recently I came across [this article](https://interviewing.io/blog/no-engineer-has-ever-sued-a-company-because-of-constructive-post-
interview-feedback-so-why-dont-employers-do-it) explaining that interviewers
should try to provide feedback to candidates after the interview, and goes on
to explain about how the feedback should be provided with examples. Further, it
also mentions that there are no known cases of any feedbacks leading to legal
action against companies, and despite this, providing feedbacks is not encouraged.

First of all, I think it has a lot to do with the culture of the company. Not that I have been at a lot of companies but certainly, where I do work, it is encouraged that interviews be two-way conversations, this  not just makes the interviewee less anxious and more comfortable, but also has the added benefit of that interviewee getting to understand the culture. Imagine giving an interview on Tuesday morning (Mondays are difficult for everybody) and the other person shows up with a really annoyed face and just grunts throughout the interview. Who would want to work there? Definitely not me.

There is another aspect to it though. Normally, you would find no mention of providing feedback to the candidate! Or it has a very small mention in the context of other things like how to take an interview, how to phrase the question etc, that this is often really ignored. It was only after reading the above article that I realised that maybe I was not letting candidates know how they fared or how they could improve further. Hindsight is certainly always 20/20, just like why it would have been a good idea to invest in stocks during the Covid downfall.
