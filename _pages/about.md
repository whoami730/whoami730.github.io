title: About Me
---

I honestly don't really know *who-am-i* or *what-am-i* etc etc, still exploring that part of my life, and well, purpose too.

Less philosophically, I worked at Rubrik Inc in the past after graduating in Computer Science and Engineering.
Currently, I am unemployed (unfortunately) and am kinda more leaned towards research than software development.
How this will eventually turn out is something I am still working on. 

Also, I do honestly love computers a lot and will try to pick any opportunity to learn
more about internals. You will find me sifting through [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) probably half of the time. Some days though, I question whether I should have taken up biology or psychology or maths
or something else instead.
